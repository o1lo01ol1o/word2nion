A handful of small experiments on NLP and non-commutive algebras.

# Current roadmap

## Sanity tests and initial exploration
- [x] Quaternion-based version of word2vec
- [ ] word2vec (skip-gram & negative sampling) 
- [ ] make sense of any differences in behavior
- [ ] UMAP plot the two embedding spaces

## higher Caley-dickson iterations
- [ ] generalize the quaternion implmentation to generate an algebra for any `N`ion


## Transformer
- [ ] replace products with `N`ion algebra
- [ ] profit?
